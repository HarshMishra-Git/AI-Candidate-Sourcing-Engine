```

#### Core Components

1. **SourcingAgent (main.py)** - Central orchestrator
2. **LinkedInSearcher (search.py)** - Candidate discovery engine
3. **CandidateScorer (score.py)** - AI-powered evaluation system
4. **MessageGenerator (message.py)** - Personalized outreach creation
5. **GroqClient (groq_utils.py)** - LLM integration layer
6. **Configuration (config.py)** - Centralized settings management

### Design Decisions

#### 1. **Multi-Source Candidate Discovery Strategy**

**Decision**: Implemented a tiered search approach with multiple fallback mechanisms.

**Rationale**: 
- **Primary**: Google Custom Search API for reliable, structured results
- **Secondary**: SerpAPI for alternative search capabilities
- **Fallback**: Web scraping with BeautifulSoup for maximum coverage

**Benefits**:
- Ensures high availability even if one API fails
- Provides redundancy for production reliability
- Maintains functionality during API rate limits

#### 2. **AI-Powered Scoring with Exact Rubric Compliance**

**Decision**: Implemented the exact 6-criteria scoring rubric as specified in hackathon requirements.

**Scoring Criteria**:
- **Education (20%)**: Academic background relevance
- **Career Trajectory (20%)**: Professional growth pattern
- **Experience Match (25%)**: Direct skills alignment
- **Company Relevance (15%)**: Previous company relevance
- **Location Match (10%)**: Geographic compatibility
- **Tenure (10%)**: Job stability and appropriate duration

**Implementation**:
- Uses Groq's LLaMA3 models for consistent, high-quality scoring
- Structured JSON output for reliable parsing
- Fallback scoring mechanism for API failures

#### 3. **Smart Caching System**

**Decision**: Implemented hash-based caching with configurable expiry.

**Features**:
- MD5 hash of job description as cache key
- 24-hour expiry for fresh results
- Automatic cache cleanup on startup
- Prevents duplicate API calls and processing

#### 4. **Batch Processing Architecture**

**Decision**: Designed for scalability with configurable batch sizes.

**Benefits**:
- Handles multiple jobs simultaneously
- Rate limiting to prevent API overload
- Async processing capabilities
- Configurable batch sizes (default: 5 candidates)

#### 5. **Frontend-Backend Separation**

**Decision**: Built modern React TypeScript frontend with FastAPI backend.

**Frontend Features**:
- Modern, responsive UI with Tailwind CSS
- Real-time loading states and error handling
- Smooth animations and user experience
- Type-safe API integration

**Backend Features**:
- RESTful API with comprehensive documentation
- CORS support for cross-origin requests
- Structured error handling and validation
- Health check endpoints

### Technical Implementation

#### 1. **LLM Integration Strategy**

**Groq API Integration**:
- Uses LLaMA3-8B-8192 as primary model
- LLaMA3-70B-8192 as fallback for complex tasks
- Structured prompt engineering for consistent outputs
- JSON response parsing with error handling

**Prompt Engineering**:
```python
# Example scoring prompt structure
messages = [
    {
        "role": "system",
        "content": "You are an expert technical recruiter. Score candidates on a scale of 1-10 for each criterion..."
    },
    {
        "role": "user", 
        "content": f"Score this candidate against the job requirements: {job_description}"
    }
]
```

#### 2. **Search Engine Optimization**

**Query Construction**:
- Intelligent keyword extraction from job descriptions
- Location-aware search parameters
- LinkedIn-specific site filtering
- Multi-page result aggregation

**Profile Extraction**:
